# Senior-Project-Robo-Roper
This is my senior project Robo-Roper. The project began this past summer and has since become my senior capstone project! I cannot go into too much detail due to legal reasons, but a high-level overview of the project includes developing an automated roping training system. This experience has been nothing but invaluable, it has given me the entire engineering process. Involving designing, simulation, testing, and reiteration. It has also humbled me extremely and made it known there is always room for improvement as an engineer! I learned a valuable lesson, communication! I quickly came to the realization I would require assistance specifically from a Mechanical Engineer because there were some problems I was having with the dynamics of the system. Had I not expressed my concern to my employer, progress would have significantly decreased. My responsibilities include programming, implementation of controls, sensor integration and simulation. Through these responsibilities I have practiced sourcing modules for correct configurations, reading data sheets, reading scholarly articles and effective communication between myself and my employer. I have attached some of the simulation files I created to show the project is feasible and can work. It utilizes simulation techniques such as data plotting, Runga Kutta (RK4), State Estimation, noise, Way point collection, PID controller, and even a velocity model was derived using Least Squares!
